    <summary>Blender is the free open source 3D content creation suite.</summary>
    <description>Blender was first conceived in December 1993 and born as a usable
	product in August 1994 as an integrated application that enables the creation
	of a diverse range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of
	modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video post-processing functionality
	in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform
	interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small footprint, and a tightly
	integrated workflow. Blender is one of the most popular Open Source 3D graphics
	applications in the world. Aimed at media professionals and artists world-wide,
	Blender can be used to create 3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and
	cinema quality videos, while the incorporation of a real-time 3D engine allows
	for the creation of 3D interactive content for stand-alone playback.</description>
